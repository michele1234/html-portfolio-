    Harvey Specter is one of New York's most prominent attorneys, cynical and ruthless, with a passion for tailored suits and social life. He has just become a senior partner in the law firm at which he works, Pearson Hardman, a role that forces him, despite himself, to take on a young associate: Harvey hates having to work in pairs, and he hates even more recent graduates fresh out of Harvard (Pearson Hardman accepts only those who graduated from Harvard). Mike Ross, on the other hand, is an extremely intelligent young man with a prodigious eidetic memory who never graduated from law school.
